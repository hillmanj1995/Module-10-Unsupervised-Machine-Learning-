# Crypto Investments Application Challenge

In this Challenge, the analyst assumed the role of an advisor in one of the top five financial advisory firms in the world. Competitors are fierce, so the analyst wanted to propose a novel approach to assembling investment portfolios that are based on cryptocurrencies. Instead of basing the proposal on only returns and volatility, they wanted to include other factors that might impact the crypto marketâ€”leading to better performance for the portfolio.

When the analyst presented the idea, their manager loved it! So, they were asked to create a prototype for submitting the crypto portfolio proposal to the company board of directors.
